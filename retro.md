Retrospective Plans

Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel: It is used to get feedback on
team process. Idea is to learn what should be continued and what should be 
adjusted. The facilitator uses a wheel to capture team’s open-ended feedback.
For the wheel you need marker and flip chart paper. The wheel is divided into
5 sections: "start", "stop", "continue", "more of" and "less of". Team gives 
comments on every category.

Glad, sad, mad: Every member of the team lists issues, changes or
observations made during the sprint and categorizes them as either glad, 
sad or mad. Glad represents positive notes, sad represents negative notes,
and mad represents “gripes” (which are often more broad than just actions 
of the team). After this the participants vote on the issues to be discussed 
and they are then discussed from highest to lowest number of votes until 
there is no time left.
